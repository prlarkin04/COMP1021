    <img class = "milk" src="milk.jpg" alt="Image of Semi Skimmed Milk" style = width:40%>

    <h3 class="mythbio">One food myth that can contribute to food waste among university students is the belief that food expiration dates, such as "best before" or "use by" dates, indicate the safety of the food rather than its quality. </h3>

    <div class="paragraph-container">
    <p>In the hustle and bustle of student life, managing expenses is a crucial skill. From textbooks to rent and groceries, every penny counts. One area where students can significantly save money is by understanding and utilizing the differences between "Best Before" and "Use By" dates on food items. These labels not only ensure food safety but can also be strategic tools in stretching a tight budget. Let's delve into what these labels mean and how students can make the most of them.</p>

    <h1 class= "mythheading" >Best Before vs. Use By Dates</h1>

    <h3>Best Before Date:</h3>

    <div class="paragraph-container">
    <p>The "Best Before" date, often abbreviated as BB or BBE (Best Before End), indicates the period during which the food product is at its best quality in terms of taste, texture, and nutritional value. It's more about quality than safety. Consuming a product after its best before date doesn't necessarily mean it's unsafe to eat, but the quality might degrade over time.</p>

    <br>

    <h3>Use By Date:</h3>
    <div class="paragraph-container">
    <p>On the other hand, the "Use By" date is a strict indicator of food safety. It's commonly found on perishable items like meat, dairy, and ready-to-eat salads. Consuming these products after the specified date could pose health risks as bacteria might have multiplied to unsafe levels.</p>

    <h1 class= "mythheading">How Students Can Save Money</h1>

    <h3>1. Prioritize Best Before Date Items:</h3>

    <div class="paragraph-container">
    <p>When shopping, prioritize products with a longer shelf life and those approaching their best before date. These items are often discounted by retailers to clear their inventory, offering significant savings for students. Canned goods, dry pasta, rice, and frozen vegetables are examples of products with extended best before dates.</p>
    </div>

    <br>
    <hr class="hr">
    <br>
    
    <h3>2. Plan Meals Around Best Before Dates:</h3>

    <div class="paragraph-container">
    <p>Create meal plans that incorporate items nearing their best before dates. This not only ensures you're consuming food before it degrades in quality but also helps in reducing food waste. Websites and apps that suggest recipes based on available ingredients can be handy for planning meals around these items.</p>
    </div>

    <br>
    <hr class="hr">
    <br>
    
    <h3>3. Utilize Freezing and Storage Techniques:</h3>

    <div class="paragraph-container">
    <p>For perishable items like meat and dairy nearing their use by dates, consider freezing them before they expire. Properly storing food items can extend their shelf life, allowing you to consume them later without compromising safety or taste. Invest in freezer-safe containers and utilize freezer space efficiently.</p>
    </div>

    <br>
    <hr class="hr">
    <br>
    
    <h3>4. Take Advantage of Clearance Sections:</h3>

    <div class="paragraph-container">
    <p>Many supermarkets have clearance sections where products nearing their best before dates are sold at discounted prices. Make it a habit to check these sections during your grocery runs. You might find perfectly good items at a fraction of the original cost.</p>
    </div>

    <br>
    <hr class="hr">
    <br>

    <h3>5. Practice Smart Shopping:</h3>

    <div class="paragraph-container">
    <p>Avoid impulse buying and stick to your shopping list. Compare prices between brands and opt for store-brand or generic products, which are often cheaper without compromising quality. Additionally, consider buying in bulk for non-perishable items to benefit from lower unit prices.</p>
    </div>

    <br>
    <hr class="hr">
    <br>

    <h3>6. Rotate Your Stock:</h3>

    <div class="paragraph-container">
    <p>Practice "first in, first out" (FIFO) when organizing your pantry and refrigerator. Place newer items at the back and older ones at the front to ensure you use items before they expire. Regularly check expiration dates and plan meals accordingly.</p>
