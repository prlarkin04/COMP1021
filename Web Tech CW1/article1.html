    <img class = "pizza" src="doughboys.jpg" alt="Image of Dough Boys Pizza" style = width:30%>
    <div class="paragraph-container">
    <p>Dough Boys are in a great spot. Head into Belgrave Music Hall and it’s the first thing you see, ideally placed for a pre, post or mid-session slice. They’ve given themselves a reputation as one of the best pizza spots in Leeds. Why? They serve up a range of creative and interesting flavours alongside tried-and-true classics. You can order by the slice or pie, with modern classics such as Salami of Darkness and its combo of Salsiccia picante, salami Napoli and house-pickled chillis, or the vegan genius, What’s the Quack? Feel free to garnish your slice with something from the condiment station – garlic oil, Parmesan and Hot Bstrd sauce all come recommended.</p>

    <img class = "pizza" src="rudys.jpg" alt="Image of Rudy's Pizza" style = width:30%>
    <div class="paragraph-container">
    <p>Rudy’s Pizza is the place to go if you’re in the mood for a bona-fide Neapolitan. This is where you’ll get that coveted perfectly thin crust with beautifully bubbled edges, perfectly soft and chewy and  great for dunking into a dip. And it’s not just in the city centre, it’s out in Headingley and Chapel Allerton too! Wherever you’re at, top picks from the alluring menu include the Calabrese, with ‘nduja sausage adding a fiery kick. Margherita comes in both traditional and buffala mozzarella options, while vegans can go for the Marinara or try one of the rotating vegan specials. It’s also pup-friendly, so you can give your pooch some under-table pizza!</p>

    <div class="paragraph-container">
    <p>Last but certainly not on the list, A new pizzeria has arrived in Leeds – Pizza Pilgrims is officially open for business! When it comes to toppings, while there’s always the tried and true classics, these guys certainly don’t shy away from unusual flavour combinations, from the Carbonara, which is loaded with al dente spaghetti to the Americana, topped with hot dog sausages and french fries. But this isn’t as weird as you may think. “In Italy, hot dog and chip pizzas are loved by kids,” Richard told us. “So, a lot of the Italian chefs say it reminds them of what they used to have every Sunday night at home. Find Pizza Pilgrims on Boar Lane”</p>
