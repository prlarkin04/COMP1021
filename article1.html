    <h3 class = "articlebio">Whether you're a picky Neapolitan purist, a Detroit Deep Dish die hard, or fall somewhere else on the wide spectrum of pizza choice, here are the best places in the city to get a pizza the action</h3>
    <h1>Dough Boys</h1>
    <p>Dough Boys are in a great spot. Head into Belgrave Music Hall and it’s the first thing you see, ideally placed for a pre, post or mid-session slice. They’ve given themselves a reputation as one of the best pizza spots in Leeds. Why? They serve up a range of creative and interesting flavours alongside tried-and-true classics. You can order by the slice or pie, with modern classics such as Salami of Darkness and its combo of Salsiccia picante, salami Napoli and house-pickled chillis, or the vegan genius, What’s the Quack? Feel free to garnish your slice with something from the condiment station – garlic oil, Parmesan and Hot Bstrd sauce all come recommended.</p>
    <h1>Rudy’s Pizza</h1>
    <p>Rudy’s Pizza is the place to go if you’re in the mood for a bona-fide Neapolitan. This is where you’ll get that coveted perfectly thin crust with beautifully bubbled edges, perfectly soft and chewy and  great for dunking into a dip. And it’s not just in the city centre, it’s out in Headingley and Chapel Allerton too! Wherever you’re at, top picks from the alluring menu include the Calabrese, with ‘nduja sausage adding a fiery kick. Margherita comes in both traditional and buffala mozzarella options, while vegans can go for the Marinara or try one of the rotating vegan specials. It’s also pup-friendly, so you can give your pooch some under-table pizza!</p>
